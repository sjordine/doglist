This project is a reference for my Medium's Collection View article.

In order to run it the APIKey.swift must be included (I suggest on Mechanisms/API group). The file is a simple Swift file with the following lines:

~~~swift
import Foundation


let apiKey = "<YOUR API KEY>"
~~~

In order to get an API Key register  in ["The Dog API"](https://thedogapi.com) to get a free one.
